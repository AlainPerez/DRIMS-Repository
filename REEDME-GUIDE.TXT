Hello,

To conduct a DRIMS test, I have created this guide.
A video (DRIMS.wmv) located in the root directory can help you visualize and work with DRIMS.

To fully run DRIMS, follow these steps:

Install a version of MySQL (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) or PostgreSQL. This guide is made with MySQL, but you can follow similar steps with PL/pgSQL.
Execute the file color_moments_MySQL.sql in a database you create. This file will create a table and populate it with part of the data from this set extracted from UCI Irvine. You can use Workbench (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).
Run the JAR from the \dist folder, where the project’s distributable is located. You must have JRE or JDK 7 installed.
Select the color_moments relation and create the rules you want, or choose the Rule Base base_reglas_colorMoments.xml. This rule base contains an RA.
Don’t forget to activate the created/chosen rule.
Generate the script and run it directly in the database to see the resources created in this first version of the tool.
If you run the function measures_update_ID, the Certainty Factor of the created rule will be calculated.
I hope you find this guide helpful and that you find the tool interesting and practical :)
If you want to support the next versions of the tool, write to: alainpa84@gmail.com
Thank you!
Best regards,
Alain
